This is Adam Garcia's Final Project for CSC 680, Mobile Application Development.

Project Idea:
  For this projet my goal was to make the mobile version of another project that
  I am working on for another class. The application that wer are making in the
  other class is a message board type application where users can create and reply
  to posts. For this application I will try and keep it simple and allow the user
  to create a post, and view the post. They will be set as a default user and that
  will be reflected in the data.

  This project is hosted on GCP and the APIs for this application were all made by
  either me or other students in my group for CSC 648. This application is all
  of our work.
