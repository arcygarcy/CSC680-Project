This is Adam Garcia's Final Project for CSC 680, Mobile Application Development.

Project Idea: For this projet my goal was to make the mobile version of another project that I am working on for another class. The application that wer are making in the other class is a message board type application where users can create and reply to posts. For this application I will try and keep it simple and allow the user to create a post, and view the post. They will be set as a default user and that will be reflected in the data.

This project is hosted on GCP and the APIs for this application were all made by either me or other students in my group for CSC 648. This application is all of our work.

This was tested on an iPhone 14, there are a few quirks that come with this project, the first of which is that I had issues making it change tab views, so that has to be done manually. The second thing is since this is my own project and we have a rather small dataset I would recommend that you search for "computer" or just individual letters and you will be shown data. When you click on a post, you will then have to click on the view post tab
